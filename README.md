# Determine-Attrition

Goals: 

Use machine learning techniques to explore the relationship between different independent variables (employees profile characteristics) and dependent variables (Attrition), 
and figure out the variables that have the most significant impact on employees leaving the company, and make recommendations accordingly.
“Employees profile” is determined by the employee's location, duration in the company, job level and so on.

Research Question:
How likely is an employee going to leave the company based on the employee profile? 

Process:

1. Data wrangling
2. Select best variables to run the classification models
3. Run models
4. predict and get indicators of goodness of the models (Confusion Matrix, Accuracy, Specificity, Sensitivity, AUC)


Models:

1. Logistic Regression
2. Classification tree

Programing languages: 
R studio

Packages: 
dplyr, ggplot2, rpart, tidyr, lattice, gbm, randomForest, library, Metrics
